Hi, I have always had a keen interest in books, both reading and writing them. In conjunction with this, I am planning to release a site that: publishes book reviews and announce book related news (such as new releases, etc.).

I also plan on including a blog on the site too, most probably created with the same Jekyll theme as this blog here. I will work on this news idea and when I have reached a concept that shows its worth and works, I shall push towards getting a full, final site made up and I will announce that in another post once it happens.

Make sure to follow the posts using the RSS link in the footer.

Anyway, that's it from me, so, until next time, see ya!
