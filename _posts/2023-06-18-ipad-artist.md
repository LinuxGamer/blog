As an learning artist, I've used many devices for my art. I've used digital art apps on my Windows laptop and now on my iPad which I got earlier this year. iPads are a great device to use even for non art activities. I have such a great experience on my iPad, so here is a rundown of what I, personally, use and recommend to all people in a similar position to me.
